  - balance: Research bomb "midpoint" at which it's worth exactly 50000 points from
      240->300
  - code_imp: doesn't snowflake the bomb cap for linux anymore, servers that need
      to tweak it can do it themselves (I didn't even put it down right, should be
      5000 instead of 50000, yikes)
